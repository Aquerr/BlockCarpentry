### Minecraft mod for 1.15.1 - small fork of the famous "Carpenters Blocks" mod for Minecraft 1.7.10
This mod adds coverable blocks (namely frames), that take on the texture of the block they contain. Currently, that works for all solid blocks.
Especially, Blockcarpentry adds normal cubes, stairs, slabs, doors, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons, fences, and a (slightly buggy) illusion block.
I'm planning and working on additional blocks, such as beds, falling blocks and walls.

### Functionality
1. You can cover a block by simply right-clicking it with the right block. This block MUST BE a solid block, otherwise nothing would happen, or you might get weird looking blocks. E.g., if you take a transparent block like glass or ice, it won't be transparent anymore. It's a known bug I'm trying to fix...
2. For blocks with different textures (e.g. the crafting table or bookshelves), you can use the texture wrench (stupid name, but I couldn't think of a better name) and right-click the frame-block to switch between the textures of the block. Does not work for all blocks at the moment. In general, it only seems to work for vanilly blocks.
3. For some blocks (e.g. the door or the trapdoor), you can choose different designs by right-clicking them with the chisel. These designs include different optical enhancements such as door knobs. (WIP)  
4. If you've chosen a design, you can toggle between some textures (e.g., for the doorknob you can choose obsidian, stone, iron block, gold block). Again, this is just for cosmetic purposes and does not change the behaviour of the block. (WIP) 
5. I can't think of any more functionality...

Have fun and best regards,
